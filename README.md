# Hardware-and-Preventive-Maintenance
## Overview
This lab focused on performing preventive maintenance to ensure hardware longevity and minimize downtime.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cleaning and inspecting internal hardware components (CPU, fans, heat sinks, etc.).
- Replacing faulty components such as RAM, power supplies, and hard drives.
- Applying thermal paste to CPUs for optimal heat dissipation.
- Creating a hardware maintenance schedule and documentation.

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Anti-static tools (wrist straps, mats).
- Compressed air and cleaning tools.
- Diagnostic software (e.g., HWMonitor, CrystalDiskInfo).

## Key Outcomes
Ensured extended hardware life by performing preventive maintenance and implementing proactive measures to reduce hardware failures.
